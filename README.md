# Asteroids

Asteroids is a small arcade-style game built with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) as a course for boot.dev. Pilot a triangular ship, blast incoming asteroids, and chase a high score while juggling limited lives.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer
- `pygame==2.6.1`
- (Optional) [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and running the project

## Setup & Run

### Option 1: Using uv

1. Install uv following the instructions for your platform.
2. In the project directory, install dependencies and run the game:
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Using python / pip

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame==2.6.1
   ```
3. Start the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- `W` / `S`: Thrust forward / backward
- `A` / `D`: Rotate left / right
- `Space`: Fire shots

Avoid collisions, split asteroids into smaller pieces, and rack up points. You begin with three livesâ€”once you lose them, your score is recorded and you return to the main menu.

## Project Notes

- `main.py` serves as the entry point and manages the game loop, menus, and HUD.
- Supporting modules define the player ship, asteroids, collision logic, and shared constants.
- The code is distributed under the terms of the included `LICENSE`.
